Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that brings JavaScript beyond the browser, allowing developers to build fast, scalable, and non-blocking server-side applications. Leveraging its event-driven architecture, high-performance V8 engine, and extensive NPM ecosystem, Node.js is commonly used for web development, APIs, real-time apps, and microservices.

This project is designed to teach key Node.js concepts through hands-on implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, forming a solid foundation for building dynamic and data-driven applications.
